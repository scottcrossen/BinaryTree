# Binary Search Tree

A simple implementation of a binary search tree.

### Description

I originally built this project to pass off the requirements for the BYU CS 235 project 6 assignment

### Explanatory Note

I created this project before I learned better practices. As such, it's not my best work, but it does help demonstrate the creativity I had even when I was learning.
